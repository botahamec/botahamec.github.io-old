			<section><p>Elp is a git helper to make some repetitive tasks much
			easier to do. Elp only has three commands, so most of what you
			to do can be done with little effort whatsoever.</p></section>
			<section>
				<h3>Usage</h3>
				<p>Elp has a grand total of three commands, all of which
				require that you have a blank repository to start</p>
				<p class="code">elp start -u</p>
				<p>This command creates a local repository and pushes it to 
				the remote repository linked. For example: 
				https://www.github.com/Botahamec/elp.git</p>
				<p class="code">elp push [TITLE] -m [MESSAGE]</p>
				<p>This command adds all the files in the current folder to the
				local repository and makes a commit with the given title and
				optional message. It then pushes the commit to the remote
				wrepository</p>
				<p class="code">elp pull</p>
				<p>Pulls from the remote repository. Simple enough.</p>

				<h3>Building</h3>
				<p>In order to build this, you'll need to have Cargo (the Rust compiler) and Git pre-installed.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Botahamec/elp.git)</li>
					<li>Run the installer script. On Unix systems, it's make_linux.sh and on Windows it's make_win.cmd</li>
					<li>Verify that it installed correctly by typing "elp -V" in a terminal</li>
				</ol>
