				We finally have a website! Here I'll show off some projects I
				worked on (all one of them). You'll notice that the style is
				terrible, but hopefully I can improve that in the future. I
				want to add more content to it as well, such as an about page,
				possibly a video feed, etc. You may be wondering why I didn't
				use a Jekyll theme for this website, and that is because I hate
				all of the Jekyll themes. I could make my own, but you can
				already tell I wouldn't be very good at it. If you have any
				specific suggestions on how I could improve, go ahead and email
				me at botahamec@outlook.com.
