			<h2>Webster 0.2 - Still Problematic</h2>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>
				I've already talked about the copious problems with my Webster
				prototype, so I made a second version, which is better but
				still not complete. I just wanna quickly go through all the
				current problems in the library
			</p>
			<p>
				Webster now has a Rule type which can specify a rule to be
				applied when comparing an attribute to a property. The problem
				is that it's still not Turing Complete, because you can't do
				something like check if the number is two times greater than
				another number. The clear way to fix this is to create a
				Modifier type to modify the value of what you're looking for.
			</p>
			<p>
				You cannot compare two attributes. For example, you don't know
				if the height of a rectangle is equal to its width. The way to
				solve this would be to add a Value type which can obtain
				attributes from an object, or create new values. This would
				replace the current system of just using the name of the
				property as the attribute that needs to be pulled.
			</p>
			<p>
				The inferencing system still doesn't work. The problem is that
				the attributes of an object are no longer certain. There are
				a couple of possible solutions. One is to keep a probability
				as to whether or not the value is correct. This will definitely
				be done in the future, but for the time being, it's too
				complicated. So how about we just don't assume the attributes
				unless the RuleType is equality?
			</p>
			<p>
				Those are just the problems that I found. Hopefully I'll get
				them fixed in the upcoming weeks. I haven't been working on
				anything that I can post here. There is something that I've
				worked on but it will take me several weeks to finish so don't
				expect to see it in like the next month or something.
