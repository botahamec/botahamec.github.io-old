			<section>
				<p>
					If you are a follower of my GitHub, you may have noticed an
					interesting project called webster-py, which is described
					as an library to assist in creating AI's with object
					permanence. I'll explain more of what this means later, but
					if you look at the code, you'll notice a dissappointing
					docstring summarizing whats going on.
				</p>
				<p class="code">
					Webster is a framework which will in the future be used for AI<br />
					Currently is not very useful other than being used to store known information<br />
					The definitions are currently the same as the actual objects, which isn't good<br />
					However, I will call this 0.1, but it does most of what I expect 1.0 to do<br />
					The problem is that the rest of what I want it to do in unpractical<br />
					It's supposed to used an advanced version of dynamic typing<br />
					Changing definitions should be able to change the value of objects in memory<br />
					But this doesn't make much sense to implement<br />
					Imagine I learned that emeralds are green but I thought rubies were emeralds<br />
					I wouldn't then conclude that rubies are green<br />
					I'd just say that rubies aren't emeralds<br />
					Anyway, here's a list of features I'll add in the future to make it better<br />
					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
					Definitions and Objects need to be separate classes<br />
					There needs to be a special DictionaryProperty class<br />
					The DictionaryProperty class will be much more robust<br />
					It will contain a binary operator, which an object will need to fulfill<br />
					Dictionaries should also have a list of digital "makefiles"<br />
					The makefiles should help the objects figure out their own properties<br />
					Definitions also should have a list of adjectives<br />
					Adjectives are boolean functions which are based on the object's properties<br />
					This requires a digital "programming language"<br />
					That's a completely different project though so I won't implement that soon<br />
					I'd also like somehow a list of the definition's abilities<br />
					These are abilities that an object of the definition can theoretically perform<br />
					This however is currently not a reasonable expectation<br />

					For the vast majority of you who don't know what's going
					on, let me explain.

			<section><h3>What's Webster Supposed To Be?</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					Webster is supposed to be an AI, in a sense, which
					keeps track of objects. It's split into two parts, a
					dictionary, and a memeory. The ditionary contains
					definitions of all possible objects, and the memory
					contains descriptions of all the objects which it knows to
					exist.
				</p>
				<p>
					"But Bota, this just sounds like a normal database."
					Well, here's the catch, based on what it knows already, it
					make make inferences about objects in the world. For
					example, since this thing is round and red, there's a good
					chance it's an apple, and because it's an apple, it
					probably tastes sweet.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section><h3>Ok, So What's Wrong With That?</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					Here's the thing: I was hoping I could make Webster simple.
					Boy, was that a mistake. Because of its simplicity, it was
					simply impractical to do any of this advanced inferencing.
					One line of logic I was planning on using was, for example,
					"This thing is a ruby. I thought rubies were green. It
					turns out they are red. This thing is red." There's an
					obvious problem with that. It would be more reasonable in
					this context to assume that the object is not a ruby. The
					problem, in the end, was that the objects didn't contain
					enough information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another problem is that the definitions are too simplistic.
					For example. The background of this page is purple (At
					least, it was when I wrote but it might have changed). So
					let's define the color purple. Purple is a color with a hex
					value of #8800ff. Here's the problem: the hex value for the
					page is not #8800ff (It's actually #2f0345). But I think we
					can still agree that it's purple. While we agree with this
					broad definition of purple, Webster has one idea of what
					purple is and it's not willing to accept any alternatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					One final problem: scale. I want Webster to eventually have
					a dictionary comparable to the produced by the
					collaboration of Mariam and Webster. Meaning it should
					contain just about every word in the English language.
					I do not plan on rerwriting the entire dictionary into
					Webster, and neither are you. So now we have a new problem,
					which is getting it to learn.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section><h3>Oh Noes! What Do We Do?</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					As you can tell by my master's thesis of a docstring above,
					I already have some solutions. I'll explain the solution I
					gave in the docstring first. More complicated Definition
					and Object classes. I won't get into too many specifics,
					but the main idea is that instead of defining a value for
					each property of a definition, I would define rules. So
					eventually it would boil down to a boolean expression which
					would say, definitively, if the object is of the given
					definition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another thing which needs to be done is for the Object
					class to have a "definition" property. This way, there can
					be some ambiguity to what the object actually is, but it
					can be definitive if we know for sure that it has the given
					definition. I don't have a great way of explaining it, but
					trust me, my ruby example from before works under this
					system.
				</p>
				<p>
					The last problem I illustrated is less solvable, but I'll
					figure that part out later. I'm sure it's doable, but I
					think the solution is outside the scope of this article.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section><h3>But Wait! I Have More Planned</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					So far I've been focusing exclusively on nouns, but I also
					want to implement other types of words (there's a word that
					people who know stuff about language would use here, but as
					you can see I don't know anything about language), such as
					adjectives and verbs. Adjectives would just have a boolean
					value representing whether or not the given adjective
					describes it. Verbs are more complicated. I'll figure that
					out later.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also want to have a sort of "digital makefile", which
					would allow an object to determine some of its properties
					based on its other properties. For example, based on the
					length of each side of a triangle, I can easily figure out
					what its area is, possibly using the laws of sines and
					cosines.
				</p>
				<p>
					And if it could have a shell, that'd be great. Just type
					values and definitions and other things into the shell and
					it learns.
				</p>

				<h4>"Hey Bota, how's your website design going?"</h4>
				<p>
					Hey, I've been busy. There's more to life than web design
					you know (Web Designers may sit down). So I will do that
					eventually, but I want to actually have content on the site
					as well, and I can't have that without working on other
					projects.
				</p>
				<h4>"So what else have you been working on?"</h4>
				<p>
					Just this weekend, Elp made v1.1. I added support for
					branches, pushing without committing, and verbose and quiet
					options.
				</p>
				<h4>"Isn't that content you could've added to the site?"</h4>
				<p>
					Fair point. Some time I need to go through and update
					documentation for all my projects. I almost decided to do
					that this weekend, but then I realized that I didn't have
					enough projects yet for that to be an issue. So once I've
					finsihed some of my other priorities, I will do that.
				</p>
				<h4>"What are you other priorities?"</h4>
				<p>
					Well, Webster for one. My goal is to implement the changes
					I've discussed here by the end of the month. At that point,
					I'll be ready to consider this project to be at v1.0. I
					also have a few Discord Bots that I've made that I want to
					get up and running. I'll discuss those at a later time. The
					bots are gonna be running on a Raspberry Pi, so I need a
					lightweight operating system to run them on that isn't
					Raspbian. I plan to make this myself, and I'm super excited
					for it. I'll make sure to tell you have that goes.
				</p>
				<h4>"Hey, did you know YouTube was a thing?"</h4>
				<p>
					You're probably referring to my lack of videos and, yes, I
					plan to upload soon, I've just been busy. I do have stuff
					planned for this week so you can expect a few videos,
					including one where I finally teach you the pronounciation
					of my username. You're welcome.
				</p>
				<h4>"So I noticed there's been a bit of a gap in your GitHub contributions..."</h4>
				<p>
					I have a life, you know. As great as projects are it's not
					gonna help much if I fail my first Computer Science class.
					Give me a break, okay?
				</p>
				<h4>"You have a StackOverflow!"</h4>
				<p>
					Yes I do, and I will try to be regularly active on it.
				</p>
				<h4>"You have 11 Reputation."</h4>
				<p>
					You need to calm down there.
				</p>
				<h4>"Okay, how do you wanna end this post?"</h4>
				<p>As soon as possible.</p>
