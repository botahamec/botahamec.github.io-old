				This is just a little website I made to show all of my one
				project and host a little blog as well. I know it looks
				terrible, but I'm working on it. I want to add an About
				page and a video feed, and also reorganize all my stuff, but
				for the time being I like what I have. If you have any
				suggestions, feel free to send those to botahamec@outlook.com
