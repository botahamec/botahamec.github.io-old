					Hello, this is just a reminder that you need to balance your
					time. I can't do that. There's so much I want to do and not
					nearly enough for me to do it. I wish there was more time in
					this world. Too much is consumed by sleep and work, and not
					enough is spared for what you love. I want to work on my music,
					my AI, my tools, my hobbies, my entertainment, my education.
					But how much of it can I really do? I don't think I'll ever
					get everything done. I could dedicate my life to these things,
					but then how could I support myself? Working enough to support
					these things means that I no longer have time to do them.
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't want to have money in my life. I want to do what I
					love, be with the people I love, and not worry about how to
					pay for my housing. Right now, I'm at the greatest point in
					my life. I don't have work, other than education. I still
					have time to work on my projects (but still not enough). I
					am, however, still removed from my loved ones. I feel it is
					too large of a price.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe there is a career that will allow me to have free
					time. Honestly, I'm pretty sure as a programmer I would.
					But how could I ever justify coding for work for eight
					hours a day, just to go and code for another two hours.
					It's too much of the same thing. I need variety in my life.
					I considered double majoring in Math Education, but does a
					math teacher really have that much free time between
					grading assignments? What is there? I doubt I could get a
					job in music composition. I was denied entry into such a
					major. I imagine even majoring in Music Composition means
					majoring in unemployment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe I can wait until I become popular enough with my
					independent work, but do I really have the time? Ah, time!
					My greatest foe. I have maybe 65 years left of life, which
					will appear to go by much quicker as they progress. *Sobs*
