				<h2>Elp - A Helper for Git</h2>
			</section>
			<section><p>
                Elp is a command-line tool I made out of frustration. I was
                frustrated of typing the same commands over and over again to
                tasks which should, in theory, be pretty simple. But do you
                what the process is for putting a local repository into an
                empty remote repository? It's four commands that I have to
                look for online every single time. And hub is no help (we'll
                talk about that later). So what if there was a tool that could
                do this for us? What if, indeed.
            </p></section>

            <section><p>
                Elp has precisely three commands. Not including "elp help". The
                first comes back to the problem I illustrated before. Putting
                your local folder into a remote repository. Without elp, it
                takes four commands to do. With Elp, you can simply use the
                start command.

            <p class="code">
                # without elp<br>
                git remote add origin https://www.github.com/Botahamec/elp.git<br>
                git add .<br>
                git commit -m "First commit"<br>
                git push origin master<br>
                <br>
                # with elp<br>
                elp start -u https://www.github.com/Botahamec/elp.git<br>

                I know what you're thinking: "Bota, that's impressive and all,
                but this isn't really something I need to do everyday. I'm
                willing to deal with this slight hiccup." And, yeah, that's not
                the best use of my tool, but you know what else is frustrating?
                Commits. I don't know why this is so hard. But you have add,
                commit and then push every time you want to make a change. At
                least, without elp you do. But Elp makes thist process super
                simple with the push command.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                # without elp<br>
                git add .<br>
                git commit -a -m "Fixed the bug"<br>
                git push origin master<br>
                <br>
                # with elp<br>
                elp push "Fixed the bug"<br>
            </p>
            </section>
            <section><p>
                You probably think this is kinda cool right now. In fact, I bet
                this is what you're thinking right now: "Gee Bota, that sounds
                epic. What could elp push possibly do?"
            </p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>
                Okay, you caught me. That command isn't of very much use. It's
                just an alias for "git pull origin master". That is all.
            </p>
            </section>
            <section><h3>Why is Elp? (Why does it exist?)</h3></section>
            <section><p>
                Another question you may have is, "Isn't this just hub?" At
                this point you should be able to see an obvious distinction.
                Hub converts GitHub repository names into urls, and Elp makes
                long and common git tasks easier. Other than the elp pull
                command, hub and elp achieve two completely different goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, so why doesn't Elp also do the things Hub does? Because I
                didn't think of it. That's the only reason why. I may add this
                functionality in an Elp 1.1
            </p>
            <p>
                Another con with Elp is that it doesn't display error messages.
                I know that sounds like it should be obvious, but clearly I
                wasn't smart enough to do that. So that's another thing which
                needs to be fixed. Sorry about that. If you accidentally fail
                the authentication, just type "git push origin master" and
                everything will be fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, if you tried to install Elp, you'd notice that the
                process of installing Elp is not much easier than using git.
                It requires you to have Cargo (the Rust compiler) pre-installed
                and makes you create a release build yourself. So that is also
                something I will have to fix in the future.

            <section>
                <p>Aha! I'm glad you asked.</p>
                <p>
                    Elp was made using the Rust programming language (which is
                    why you need Cargo to install it). I like Rust because it's
                    relatively simple and it has performance on par with C. I
                    don't like using libraries for simple tasks, but I decided
                    that since I had no idea how to create a command-line-tool
                    without one, I used the clap crate (Rust calls libraries
                    crates because it doesn't liek being normal). Clap is easy,
                    kinda. Some learning is required. Actually the reason Elp
                    is on 1.0.4 right now is because of all the undiscovered
                    bugs I had because I wasn't using Clap correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The actual commands aren't really that complicated. It just
                    runs terminal commands. I thought about using a git library
                    but I don't think that'd be any more efficient and it's
                    just another thing that would have to be compiled. So the
                    only real dependency aside from the compiler is git. It
                    seems reasonable to assume that everybody has git.

            <section><h3>Conclusion</h3></section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    I definitely can improve on Elp. The error messages and
                    repository name support would definitely be a good start.
                    I also need to make a less stupid installation process.
                    Other than that, I use elp pretty much every day, and I
                    think it is a game-changer. Everything is much simpler.

                    amount of Github I suggest you give it a try. I use it
                    pretty much every day at this point.
