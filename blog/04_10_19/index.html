                    So, not gonna lie, this site looks pretty awful. I want to
                    fix that. So let's explore some of the ways we can do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site was written in pure HTML. You may be wondering
                    why I didn't use Markdown, since that would be much easier,
                    and I'm using Github Pages anyway. The problem is that it
                    would require me to use a Jekyll theme. I hate all of the
                    Jekyll templates and I don't feel too inclined to make my
                    own. So I decided to just create the site from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>"But Bota, you used your own theme and it's still bad"</p>
                <p>Ok, fair, but at least I can try to make it better.</p>
                <p>
                    So now let me get the biggest lie I've ever told you out
                    of the way, because I'm not gonna explore ways to make the
                    site look better, because I don't know how. If I did, I
                    probably would've implemented them instead of writing this
                    blog. I'm not a designer. I don't know how to do this sort
                    of thing. I do, however, have a sort of framework for
                    things I can do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, I have to look at the website. Just getting myself
                    to look at my work every once in a while should help me to
                    actually figure out what I don't like about it. Right now,
                    I really think the colors need to change. So the next time
                    I make an update to the site, I'll know to use new colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing is to have other people look at the site. I
                    go to school at the Rochester Institute of Technology for
                    god's sake. I'm surrounded by nerds who specialize in all
                    different fields, including web design. So if I can harass
                    a design friend to help me with this, then I can get some
                    good feedback on how to improve the site. (This requires me
                    to gain a design friend)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I need to not completely rely on myself. All of my
                    projects (I swear I'm working on more projects, just I'm
                    only showing one on this site at the moment) are
                    open-source, and this website is open-source, which means I
                    can look at other open-source projects for inspiration. I
                    doubt I'll blatantly copy anyone specifically, but I think
                    I can get away with copying elements of other websites.
                    There are plenty of online tools I can use to create color
                    schemes that don't suck. Okay, that's the only example I
                    can think of at the moment, but you get the point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know exactly what the purpose of writing this was.
                    If nothing else, I hope now you at least know that I'm
                    trying. You also got to see a little bit of the inner
                    workings of my mind. Also, content! In any event, I hope
                    you've enjoyed reading this, and stick around for more.
