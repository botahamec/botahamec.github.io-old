		<section><h2>Thoughts on the Citizenship Test</h2></section>
		<section>
			<p>
				So I've been thinking about the following question: "Should
				there be a citizenship test for those who were born in
				America?" I kept thinking about this and I think I've come to a
				good conclusion. So here's my bold claim: I don't think there
				should be a citizenship test at all. That includes for
				immigrants.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think a good place to start would be to explain why I don't
				think there should be a citizenship test for those who were
				born here. The common rationale for such a system is that it
				makes sense to make sure people know how the government works
				before they make decisions on it. The problem is that
				citizenship is also linked to other things, such as social
				security. It doesn't make much sense to deny someone social
				security based on whether or not they know the three branches
				of government.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Why not just make a test in order to vote?" Well, some people
				would say that the Constitution forbids this and then just stop
				there. But that doesn't make for a very convincing argument.
				The reason why the Constitution forbids this is because states
				would require literacy tests in order to vote. Recently
				emancipated slaves did not know how to read and were therefore
				not able to vote. My basic point is that it's impossible to
				know that any given test is necessarily fair. I would say it's
				more acceptable to let uneducated people vote rather than
				exclude a large group of people.
			</p>
			<p>
				So let's move on to immigrants. What exactly is the purpose of
				a citizenship test? If it's tomake sure they know how the
				government works, we already established why we can't use that.
				Now, it's going to seem like I'm backpedaling here, but trust
				me, I'm not. I'm going to make a bigger point later. I would
				make the argument that there should be a test for immigrants
				for one reason: to ensure that they know what the laws are so
				they know what is expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here's the problem. Most immigrants are here long before they
				become citizens, whether it's by refugee status, green card,
				etc. We still benefit from them knowing the laws before they
				become citizens. So that's why I think the test should be
				administered as they come into the country. I think the best
				way of enacting this would be to give a pamphlet explaining
				what they would need to know for the test (and obviously this
				would be translated into every language) and make the test as
				fast as possible. And don't be stupid. They probably guessed
				that murder and theft are illegal. They also don't need to know
				about the laws regarding water safety, but make sure they know
				the non-obvious basics, like the rights regarding searches and
				self-protection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this would definitely not be the current citizenship
				test. Most citizens can't pass that. Also I would be in favor
				of making immigration easier, at the very least to compensate
				for the extra test. I don't feel qualified enough to explain
				what I think should be done on that front. I'm probably in over
				my head already.
