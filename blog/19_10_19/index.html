			<section><p>
				So I've been using Elp for a while now and even though I
				love it and it makes a lot of tasks simpler for me, I must
				admit that it has some issues. So over the past weekened, I
				took the time to iron out some of the kinks and I think it
				is now 100% better. So allow me to explain what has changed

				Some of you probably don't follow this blog well enough to
				actually know what Elp is, so let me explain. Elp is a
				command-line tool used to make many common tasks easier, such
				as committing. It takes a few commands to actually make a
				change. First, you have to add all the files. Then, you have to
				commit your changes. And THEN, you have to actually push your
				commits. I found this process unnecessary. So I simplified it
				to one command: "elp push [TITLE] -m &lt;MESSAGE&gt;"
