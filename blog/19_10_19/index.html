			<section><h2>Elp 1.1 To The Rescue</h2></section>
			<section><p>
				So I've been using Elp for a while now and even though I
				love it and it makes a lot of tasks simpler for me, I must
				admit that it has some issues. So over the past weekened, I
				took the time to iron out some of the kinks and I think it
				is now 100% better. So allow me to explain what has changed
			</p></section>
			<section><h3>What is Elp?</h3></section>
			<section><p>
				Some of you probably don't follow this blog well enough to
				actually know what Elp is, so let me explain. Elp is a
				command-line tool used to make many common tasks easier, such
				as committing. It takes a few commands to actually make a
				change. First, you have to add all the files. Then, you have to
				commit your changes. And THEN, you have to actually push your
				commits. I found this process unnecessary. So I simplified it
				to one command: "elp push [TITLE] -m &lt;MESSAGE&gt;". The
				message at the end is optional if you haven't figured that out.
			</p></section>
			<section><h3>O HAIL OUTPUT</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					Any output from the git commands will now be outputted by
					Elp. You're welcome.
				</p>
				<img src="output.png" alt="Output of the elp push command" />
				<p>"Wait. Why wasn't that there before?"</p>
				<p>... Because... Ok I don't really have a good excuse.</p>
			</section>
			<section><h3>Changes to Existing Commands</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					Not gonna lie, the "elp start" command is pretty useless if
					you don't specify a URL. So it no longer requires the -u
					and instead just requires a URL to run.
				</p>
				<p class="code">
					# before<br />
					elp push -u https://github.com/Botahamec/elp.git<br />
					<br />
					# after<br />
					elp push https://github.com/Botahamec/elp.git<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					There have been many times when I did "elp push", typed my
					password wrong, and then typed "elp push" again, which led
					to two commits being created. This was pointless, so I
					fixed that by adding a -n (--no-commit) option to the
					command. When this option is passed in, no commit is made,
					and Elp simply pushes
				</p>
			</section>
			<section><h3>New Flags</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					It's common for command line tools to have -v and -q
					options, which mean verbose and quiet respectively. Git is
					no exception, and certain commands in git also let you use
					-vv for extra verbosity. I'm not going to stop people from
					their dream of getting the scroll bar to near-zero size, so
					I added that to Elp as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those of you who didn't figure it out, verbose means
					that extra stuff is outputted and quiet means that nothing
					is outputted. No, you cannot be both quiet and verbose at
					same time. Elp will yell at you.
				</p>
				<img src="contradiction.png" href="what happens when you play god" />
				<p>
					I should also mention that both of these flags need to be
					used before the subcommand. That's another thing I can fix
					for Elp 1.1.1 or maybe Elp 1.2.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section><h3>The Source Code has an Update Command?</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					Ok so here's the thing. I added a command to update Elp,
					but it requires a shell script in order to be run. The
					thing is, most people won't have the shell script, and
					wouldn't be able to run the command, so I commented it out.
					That definitely would be fixed before I release Elp 1.2. I
					just need to figure out where the shell scripts would be
					installed. (I also just realized that I probably would want
					to provide an easy way to uninstall them in this scenario)
				</p>

			<section><h3>Captain Miscellaneous</h3></section>
			<section>
				<p>
					I loved doing this segment last time, so we're doing it
					again. In case it's unclear, Captain Miscellaneous is my
					character, who asks me questions about how my weeks been
					going, in the most aggressive way possible. Alright, Cap,
					take it away.
				</p>
				<h4>"You promised a couple of videos by the end of the week..."</h4>
				<p>
					Ok, so I consider Sunday to be the last day of the week, so
					I still actually have time. The one video I want to make is
					actually pretty short, I just need a quiet place to record
					it. The other video I want to make is just a timelapse of
					me making Elp 1.1, so really I just need to edit it.
				</p>
				<p>TLDR: I'm working on it</p>
				<h4>"The documentation for Elp doesn't mention anything you talked about today"</h4>
				<p>
					Yeah. I have basically no free time at the moment. I've
					been busy pretty much the entire week. A last week,
					I was super productive, and I managed to make my own fork
					of Rawr as well as the DevHumor discord bot, but this week
					was not as kind. My current plan is to get my discord bots
					up and running this weekend, then next week I'll complete
					Webster, and the following week, I want to go back and
					update the documentation for all of my previous projects.
				</p>
				<h4>"How is your week?"</h4>
				<p>
					Wow, that's an excellent question. I went home last weekend
					for Indigenous People's Day Break, my family came to the
					Rochester Institute of Technology this week to visit for
					Brick City Homecoming, and I got to see Anderson Cooper.
					Not gonna lie, I could share some great stories, but I
					think that would be invading his privacy. The rest of the
					week was just a lot. I have a bunch of exams and homework
					that got crammed into three days, but I got a lot done so
					far, so hopefully my schedule next week will be clear.
